# Reflective Validation Workflow - Career Helper

**Purpose:** Ensure generated career content meets quality standards before presenting to user.

**Based on:** Anthropic's [Evaluator-Optimizer Pattern](https://www.anthropic.com/research/building-effective-agents)

---

## When to Use This Workflow

**Always validate for:**
- resume/ATS optimization (critical - affects job applications)
- Company research briefs (citations must be accurate)
- Interview preparation (answers must be evidence-backed)
- LinkedIn profile recommendations (professional reputation at stake)

**Skip validation for:**
- Quick questions about capabilities
- Clarification requests
- Brainstorming/ideation

---

## The Reflect-Validate Loop

```
Generate → Evaluate → If NEEDS_IMPROVEMENT → Refine → Re-evaluate
                    → If PASS → Present to user
                    → Max 3 iterations
```

## Language Compliance (US English)

**Check BEFORE capability-specific validation:**

| Check | Pass | Fail |
|-------|------|------|
| **UK Spelling** | organisation, colour, behaviour, optimise, analyse, centre | organisation, color, behavior, optimize, analyze, center |
| **Em Dashes** | None present | — used anywhere |
| **Override** | US role explicitly requires US English | Default should be UK |

**Common UK vs US Spelling:**
| UK (Correct) | US (Incorrect) |
|--------------|----------------|
| organisation | organisation |
| colour | color |
| behaviour | behavior |
| optimise | optimize |
| analyse | analyze |
| centre | center |
| programme | program |
| favour | favor |
| honour | honor |
| labor | labor |
| recognise | recognize |
| realise | realize |
| specialise | specialize |
| summarise | summarize |
| personalise | personalize |
| customise | customize |
| prioritise | prioritize |
| maximise | maximize |
| minimise | minimize |

**Language Validation Output Format:**
```xml
<language_evaluation>PASS | NEEDS_IMPROVEMENT | FAIL</language_evaluation>
<language_feedback>
- US spellings found: [list with UK corrections]
- Em dashes found: [locations]
</language_feedback>
```

**Note:** If user explicitly targets US role or requests US English, UK spelling check is skipped.

## Validation Criteria by Capability

### 1. resume/ATS Optimisation

**Content Requirements:**
| Criterion | Check |
|-----------|-------|
| **Source Traceability** | Can every substantive bullet cite its source (master facts file, current resume, or explicit conversation turn)? |
| **No Invented Content** | No modifiers, scope, geography, or timing details added beyond the source? |
| **Keyword Coverage (minimum gate)** | ≥70% of JD keywords integrated, using only verified experience. Below 70% → NEEDS_IMPROVEMENT. |
| **Quantified Achievements** | Numbers, percentages, metrics present, all traceable to source? |
| **ATS-Safe Formatting** | No tables, graphics, columns, fancy fonts? |
| **Role Alignment** | Summary/headline matches target role using verified language? |
| **Skills Match** | Skills section reflects JD requirements and user's documented expertise? |

**Note on coverage thresholds:** This 70% figure is the *minimum acceptance gate*; content below this threshold gets refined before delivery. The companion `@ATS-Helper.md` defines a separate *aspirational target* of 90%, which is what a strong rewrite aims for when verified evidence supports it. Coverage between 70 and 90 percent passes validation but should still be improved if the source allows.

**Traceability Check (run before any other resume check):**

For every substantive bullet in the draft resume, answer:
1. Which source entry does this bullet come from? (Master facts section, resume section, or conversation turn.)
2. Are all substantive words present in that source, or traceable to a verified alternative in the source?
3. If rephrased, does the meaning remain identical?
4. Have only redundant words been removed, never added meaning?

If any bullet fails traceability, mark the whole resume as NEEDS_IMPROVEMENT and refine before continuing to keyword coverage.

**Hallucination Red Flag Scan:**

Before delivery, scan the draft for these patterns. If any appear and cannot be cited to source, remove them:

- Adjectives: "strategic", "innovative", "comprehensive", "robust", "world-class", "industry-leading"
- Team composition: "cross-functional", "distributed", "diverse", "matrixed"
- Geographic scope: "across X countries", "global", "EMEA-wide"
- Reporting structure: "direct reports", "dotted line", "matrixed"
- Timing: "within X months", "in the first Y", "by Q3"
- Hybrid bullets stitched from different source bullets
- Combined metrics from different achievements

See `@verified-content-guardrails.md` for the full guardrail rules.

**Output Format:**
```xml
<cv_evaluation>PASS | NEEDS_IMPROVEMENT | FAIL</cv_evaluation>
<cv_feedback>
- Traceability: X of Y bullets have a citable source (target: 100%)
- Hallucination red flags found: [list with locations]
- Keyword coverage: X% (target: 70%+)
- Missing key terms: [list]
- Formatting issues: [list]
- Suggested improvements: [specific changes using verified content only]
</cv_feedback>
```

### 2. Company Research Briefs

**Content Requirements:**
| Criterion | Check |
|-----------|-------|
| **All Sections Present** | Overview, Leadership, Culture, Competitors, News, Red Flags? |
| **Citation Quality** | EVERY factual claim has a source? |
| **Source Recency** | News from last 6-12 months? |
| **Source Diversity** | Multiple source types used? |
| **Red Flags Assessed** | Risk section included and honest? |

**Citation Validation:**
```xml
<citation_evaluation>PASS | NEEDS_IMPROVEMENT | FAIL</citation_evaluation>
<citation_feedback>
- Claims without sources: [list]
- Outdated sources: [list]
- Missing perspectives: [list]
</citation_feedback>
```

**CRITICAL:** Citation quality is this skill's differentiator. NO uncited claims allowed.

### 3. Interview Preparation

**Content Requirements:**
| Criterion | Check |
|-----------|-------|
| **Question Coverage** | Behavioral, technical, culture, ask-interviewer? |
| **STAR Format** | Behavioral answers use Situation-Task-Action-Result? |
| **Role Specificity** | Questions tailored to specific role/level? |
| **Company Context** | Talking points reference company specifics? |
| **Evidence-Based** | Answers include specific examples? |

**Output Format:**
```xml
<interview_evaluation>PASS | NEEDS_IMPROVEMENT | FAIL</interview_evaluation>
<interview_feedback>
- Missing question types: [list]
- Generic answers (need personalization): [list]
- STAR format issues: [list]
</interview_feedback>
```

### 4. LinkedIn Profile Optimization

**Content Requirements:**
| Criterion | Check |
|-----------|-------|
| **All Sections Reviewed** | Photo, banner, headline, about, experience, skills, recommendations? |
| **Headline Optimized** | Contains role keywords, clear value proposition? |
| **About Section** | Compelling, keyword-rich, appropriate length? |
| **Skills Ordering** | RSC API top 3 considered? |

<linkedin_feedback>
- Sections not reviewed: [list]
- Headline issues: [details]
- About section improvements: [details]
</linkedin_feedback>
```

### 5. Strategic Networking

## Implementation Workflow

### Step 1: Generate Initial Content

Create the requested career deliverable following the appropriate template and loading relevant supporting prompts.

### Step 2: Self-Evaluate

Before presenting to user, run internal validation:

```markdown
## Internal Validation Check

### Capability: [resume/Research/Interview/LinkedIn/Networking/Content]

**Content Completeness:**
- [ ] All required sections present?
- [ ] Appropriate template structure used?
- [ ] User's specific context incorporated?

**Quality Checks:**
- [ ] [Capability-specific checks from above]

**Citation Check (if applicable):**
- [ ] Every factual claim has a source?
- [ ] Sources are recent and credible?

**Status:** PASS / NEEDS_IMPROVEMENT / FAIL
```

### Step 3: Iterate if Needed

If NEEDS_IMPROVEMENT:
1. Note specific issues
2. Refine content addressing each issue
3. Re-evaluate
4. Maximum 3 iterations

### Step 4: Present with Confidence Statement

When presenting validated content:

```markdown
## [Deliverable Title]

[Content]

---

**Quality Assurance:**
- ✅ [Key validation point 1]
- ✅ [Key validation point 2]
- ✅ Citations verified (if applicable)

*This content has been validated against Career Helper quality standards.*
```

---

## Special Validation Rules

### Citation Requirements (Research & Interview)

**MANDATORY for:**
- Company research briefs
- Interview preparation (company facts)
- Any factual claims about companies, people, or market data

**Format:**
- Inline: "[Source: Publication/URL]"
- Or footnotes at section end
- Include access date for web sources

**Validation:**
```
For each factual claim:
1. Is there a source? → If no, ADD SOURCE or REMOVE CLAIM
2. Is source credible? → News, official sites, analyst reports preferred
3. Is source recent? → News <12 months, company info <6 months ideal
```

### ATS Safety (resume Optimization)

**ALWAYS validate resume outputs for:**
- No tables (will be scrambled by ATS)
- No columns (parsing issues)
- No graphics/images (ignored by ATS)
- No headers/footers (often stripped)
- No fancy fonts (may not render)
- Standard section headings (Experience, Education, Skills)
- Contact info at top (not in header)

### Career Stage Appropriateness

**Consider user's career stage when validating tone:**
- Early career: More guidance, less assumed knowledge
- Mid-career: Balance of guidance and peer-level advice
- Senior: Strategic, executive tone, assume experience
