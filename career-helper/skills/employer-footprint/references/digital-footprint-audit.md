## Research Methodology

**Agentic Deep-Research Swarm Approach:**

This prompt is designed to execute multiple research agents simultaneously, each specialising in a different channel or analysis dimension. When possible, use Task tool with subagent_type=Explore or invoke parallel WebSearch/WebFetch operations.

**Research Principles:**
- Only analyse **publicly available** information
- All findings must be cited with source URL and access date
- Distinguish between confirmed facts and inferences
- Note when content is private/inaccessible (do NOT attempt to bypass privacy)
- Score findings on a consistent 1-10 scale with text-label ratings (GREEN/AMBER/RED)
- Focus on employer-relevant signals, not personal judgement

## Parallel Research Agents

Execute these research threads simultaneously using Task tool:

### Agent 1: Google Presence Search

Search for the candidate as a recruiter would:

```
Search Queries (execute in parallel):
1. "{full name}" - bare name search
2. "{full name}" + "{current company}" - professional context
3. "{full name}" + "{target role title}" - role context
4. "{full name}" + LinkedIn - profile discovery
5. "{full name}" + "{industry}" - industry presence

Analyse:
- What appears on the first 3 pages of results?
- Is the candidate easily findable?
- Are there name conflicts (other people with same name)?
- What's the overall first impression?
- Are there any surprising or concerning results?
```

### Agent 2: LinkedIn Analysis

Assess LinkedIn presence through recruiter eyes:

```
Check (via WebSearch - LinkedIn blocks WebFetch):
- Profile completeness (headline, summary, experience, skills, education)
- Professional headline quality
- Activity level (posts, comments, engagement frequency)
- Recommendations count and quality
- Endorsements relevance
- Connections count (signal vs noise)
- Featured content quality
- Profile photo professionalism
- URL customisation
- Consistency with resume (dates, titles, companies)

If LinkedIn is inaccessible:
- Ask user to screenshot their profile
- Or ask for LinkedIn profile review output from /linkedin-coach
```

### Agent 3: Twitter/X Audit

Assess Twitter/X presence if handle provided:

```
Search Queries:
1. "from:{handle}" recent tweets - tone and content
2. "{handle}" site:twitter.com OR site:x.com - external references
3. "{full name}" site:twitter.com OR site:x.com - name mentions

Analyse:
- Overall tone (professional, casual, political, controversial)
- Frequency of posting
- Topics covered (professional vs personal mix)
- Potentially controversial posts or retweets
- Engagement with others (constructive or combative)
- Profile bio and branding
- Does it enhance or detract from professional image?
```

### Agent 4: GitHub Profile

Assess technical presence if username provided:

```
Search/Fetch:
1. github.com/{username} - profile overview
2. Public repositories - quality, activity, documentation
3. Contribution graph - consistency of activity
4. README.md - personal branding quality
5. Stars and forks - project impact

Analyse:
- Profile completeness (bio, photo, location, links)
- Repository quality (documentation, code quality indicators)
- Contribution consistency (sparse vs regular)
- Open source engagement
- Technology signals (languages, frameworks)
- Professional README quality
- Does activity match resume claims?
```

### Agent 5: Other Social Platforms

Check additional platforms based on user-provided handles:

```
Platforms to Check:
- Facebook (public posts/profile only)
- Instagram (public posts/profile only)
- Medium (articles, followers, engagement)
- YouTube (videos, comments, channel content)
- Stack Overflow (reputation, question/answer quality)
- Behance/Dribbble (portfolio quality - for design roles)
- Personal website/blog (content, design, currency)

For Each Platform:
- Is the profile public?
- What's the professional impression?
- Any content that could concern an employer?
- Does it add to or detract from the professional brand?
```

### Agent 6: News & Media Presence

Search for media mentions and public appearances:

```
Search Queries:
1. "{full name}" AND (interview OR quoted OR speaker OR panel OR conference)
2. "{full name}" AND (news OR press OR media OR article)
3. "{full name}" AND ({industry} OR {company})

Analyse:
- Press mentions or quotes
- Conference speaking engagements
- Published articles or thought pieces
- Podcast appearances
- Awards or recognition
- Any negative media coverage
```

### Agent 7: Company Culture Research

If target company provided, research their values and what they look for:

```
Search Queries:
1. "{company name}" values culture
2. "{company name}" hiring what we look for
3. "{company name}" employee qualities
4. "{company name}" Glassdoor culture
5. "{company name}" diversity inclusion values

Analyse:
- Stated company values
- Cultural signals (formal vs casual, innovative vs traditional)
- What they publicly say they look for in candidates
- DEI commitments and signals
- Work style (collaborative, autonomous, etc.)
- Communication style expectations
```

### Agent 8: Red Flag Scanner

Dedicated search for potentially concerning content:

```
Search Queries:
1. "{full name}" AND (controversial OR fired OR complaint OR lawsuit)
2. "{full name}" AND (political OR protest OR activism)
3. "{full name}" AND (arrested OR charged OR convicted)
4. "{full name}" social media controversy

Cross-Reference Checks:
- resume dates vs LinkedIn dates (inconsistencies?)
- Job title inflation (resume says "Director", LinkedIn says "Manager"?)
- Employment gaps not explained
- Qualifications claims vs verifiable records
- Company claims vs company size/existence

Note: Flag findings objectively without moral judgement.
Political views and legal activism are not inherently red flags
but some employers may view them differently. Present facts,
let the user decide how to handle.
```

What are the 3-5 things that could give an employer pause?

### Step 4: Map to Company Values
If target company provided, map findings against their stated values.

## Parallel Execution Strategy

**CRITICAL: Use parallel Task tool calls for maximum speed and depth.**

```markdown
Wave 1 (All Parallel - Launch Simultaneously):
- Task Agent: Google presence search (all name variations)
- Task Agent: Company culture research (if target provided)
- WebSearch: LinkedIn profile discovery
- WebSearch: Twitter/X content audit
- WebSearch: GitHub profile analysis
- WebSearch: News and media mentions

Wave 2 (After Wave 1 - Parallel):
- Task Agent: Deep-dive on flagged content from Wave 1
- Task Agent: Cross-reference resume against all online findings
- WebSearch: Red flag scan with specific terms
- WebSearch: Additional platforms (Medium, Stack Overflow, etc.)
- WebFetch: Personal website/blog content analysis

Wave 3 (Synthesis - Sequential):
- Score all 8 dimensions with evidence
- Generate dashboard using template
- Map to company values (if applicable)
- Generate recommendations
- Suggest career-helper next actions
```

**WebFetch Limitations:**
- Company websites: WebFetch works well
- LinkedIn profiles: Blocked - use WebSearch or ask user for screenshot
- Twitter/X: May be restricted - use WebSearch for summaries
- Facebook/Instagram: Usually blocked - note as [PRIVATE] if inaccessible

**Human-in-the-Loop Fallback:**

When content is inaccessible:
```markdown
"I'm unable to access your [platform] profile directly due to access restrictions.

Can you help by:
1. **Screenshot**: Take a screenshot and provide the file path
2. **Copy/paste**: Share the relevant content directly
3. **PDF**: Save the page as PDF and provide the path

Which works best for you?"
```

## Privacy and Ethics Guidelines

- **Only analyse publicly available information** - Never attempt to access private accounts
- **Present facts objectively** - Do not judge personal views, political opinions, or lifestyle choices
- **Context matters** - A tweet from 10 years ago when the person was a student carries different weight than a recent professional post
- **Note what's NOT found** - Absence of information is itself informative
- **Respect boundaries** - If the user says something is off-limits, exclude it
- **Recommend privacy improvements** - If private content is leaking publicly, flag it as a recommendation
- **No dark patterns** - Do not search court records, arrest records, or similar unless the user specifically requests it and provides clear context

---

## Output

Use the footprint-dashboard-template.md for final output.

Generate the file as: `{name-slug}-footprint-dashboard.md`

If target company provided, also generate: `{name-slug}-{company-slug}-employer-impression.md`
