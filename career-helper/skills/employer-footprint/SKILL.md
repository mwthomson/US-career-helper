# Employer Footprint Analysis

See yourself through an employer's eyes. A deep-research swarm audit of your digital footprint, synthesized into a credit-report style dashboard with actionable recommendations.

## Capabilities

| # | Capability | When to Use |
|:--|:-----------|:------------|
| 1 | Full Footprint Analysis | Complete audit: social media, public content, employer impression dashboard |
| 2 | Social Media Audit | Focused audit of specific social channels |
| 3 | Employer Impression Report | How a specific company/role would interpret your online presence |
| 4 | Interview Prep from Footprint | Generate likely interview questions based on your digital presence |

## Quick Start

```
"Check my digital footprint before I apply to the NHS"
"What would a recruiter find if they searched for me online?"
"Audit my LinkedIn and Twitter for red flags"
"Generate interview questions based on what's publicly visible about me"
```

---

## Accessibility

**At skill start**, check for `career-helper-preferences.md` in the current working directory using the Glob tool. If found, read the YAML frontmatter and apply:

- **dyslexia_friendly: true** → Use short sentences. Number all lists and options (never unnumbered). One decision per message. No idioms or metaphors — use plain replacements. Explicit signposting at every transition ("Step 2 of 4. Next: employer impression report."). Refer to saved files by description, not filename. Repeat key details (company names, role titles, dates) — do not assume the user remembers from earlier messages.
- **colour_blind: true** → Never use color alone to convey meaning. Use labels, text, or icons for all status indicators. Dashboard scores must use text labels, not color coding.

If **no preferences file exists** and this skill was invoked directly (not dispatched by Tim): ask once — "Do you have any accessibility preferences I should know about? For example, if you're dyslexic I can adjust how I format things." If yes, save to `career-helper-preferences.md` using the format documented in the Tim skill before continuing. If the user declines or says no, proceed without creating the file.

These rules apply to **all communication with the user** and to the **formatting of output documents**.

## How It Works

This skill uses an **agentic deep-research swarm** approach:

1. **You provide** your name, resume, social media handles, and target company/role
2. **Parallel research agents** scan publicly available data across multiple channels simultaneously
3. **Employer lens analysis** interprets findings through the target company's values and culture
4. **Dashboard synthesis** produces a credit-report style output with positive/negative indicators
5. **Recommendations** suggest next actions across career-helper skills

## Input Gathering

Before starting any analysis, collect the following via AskUserQuestion:

### Required Information

**Question 1: Basic Details**
"To analyze your digital footprint, I need some details. Let's start with the basics - what is your full name (as it appears professionally)?"

**Question 2: Social Media Handles**
"Which social media platforms do you use? Please share your usernames/URLs for any that apply:"
- LinkedIn profile URL
- GitHub username
- Twitter/X handle
- Personal website or blog URL
- Any other professional platforms (Medium, Stack Overflow, Behance, Dribbble, YouTube, etc.)

**Question 3: Target Context**
"Are you targeting a specific company and role? If so, please share:"
- Company name
- Role title
- Job description (if available)

**Question 4: resume**
"Please share your resume - either paste the text, provide a file path, or upload it."

**Question 5: Concerns**
"Is there anything specific you're worried an employer might find? (This helps me focus the analysis - everything stays private.)"

## Deep Research Validation

All research uses a rigorous multi-cycle validation workflow:
**Load:** @references/deep-research-reflection.md

- **Gap Analysis** - After initial search, identify what's missing
- **Counter-Evidence Search** - Actively search for contradicting information
- **Source Credibility Scoring** - Primary sources weighted over secondary
- **Red Flag Hunting** - Proactively search for negative/controversial content
- **Citation Requirements** - All findings include source URLs and access dates

---

## Parallel Execution Strategy

**CRITICAL: Use parallel Task tool calls for maximum speed and depth.**

```markdown
Wave 1 (Parallel):
- Task Agent: Google presence search (name variations)
- Task Agent: Company culture and values research
- WebSearch: LinkedIn profile analysis
- WebSearch: Twitter/X content audit
- WebSearch: GitHub profile analysis

Wave 2 (After Wave 1 results):
- Task Agent: Deep-dive on flagged content
- Task Agent: Cross-reference resume against online presence
- WebSearch: Fill identified gaps
- WebSearch: Counter-evidence and red flag hunt

Wave 3 (Synthesis):
- Score all dimensions
- Generate dashboard
- Map to employer values
- Generate recommendations
```

---

## Persona Adaptation

When the user's context matches a specific persona, adapt the analysis focus:

| Persona | Adaptation | Trigger |
|:--------|:----------|:--------|
| Career Returner | Focus on explaining gaps positively; check if old profiles are outdated | User mentions career break |
| Early Career | Emphasize building presence rather than auditing; check student social media | Graduate or limited experience |
| Senior/Executive | Focus on thought leadership, board-level presence, media mentions | VP+ or C-suite level |
| NED/Board | Governance signals, independence markers, conflicts of interest | Board or trustee roles |
| Fractional | Multi-company narrative consistency, expertise positioning | Portfolio or fractional career |

---

## Output Standards

- **US English** throughout (unless non-US role explicitly requires US English)
- **No emojis** - Professional tone
- **Cited sources** - All findings include URLs and access dates
- **Text-label ratings** — GREEN/AMBER/RED as text, never color alone
- **Evidence-based** - Every flag backed by specific findings
- **Never invent data** - Mark missing info as `[NOT FOUND]` or `[PRIVATE]`
- **Privacy-conscious** - Only analyze publicly available information

### Tone of Voice
- Address the user as "you", not by name: "Your digital presence shows..." not "Bethan's digital presence shows..." — default to second person for warmth and engagement; occasional name use is fine for emphasis
- Avoid hyperbole and cinema poster phrasing (not "game-changing", "revolutionary", or "supercharge your career")
- Use the **Oxford comma** (serial comma: "skills, experience, and qualifications")
- Never use em dashes. Use commas, semicolons, colons, or full stops instead

### Template Usage

When a capability specifies a template, you MUST:
1. Load the template first using @ symbol
2. Follow the template structure exactly
3. Preserve template footers

### Working with Blocked Content

When WebFetch fails (LinkedIn, Glassdoor, paywalled content):
- Ask user to screenshot the page (Read tool processes images)
- Or copy/paste text directly
- Or save as PDF and provide path
- Only request screenshots for critical content (top 3-5 items)

---

## Workspace Recommendation

**IMPORTANT:** For the best experience, always use the same local folder for your career-helper sessions. This allows you to:
- Build on previous analyses across sessions
- Keep all career-helper outputs in one place
- Reference earlier reports when running new skills
- Track your progress over time

**Recommended setup:**
```
mkdir -p ~/career-helper-workspace
cd ~/career-helper-workspace
```

Then run all career-helper skills from this folder. Use `/career-helper:status` to see all your generated outputs.

## Recommended Next Actions

After completing a footprint analysis, career-helper can help you act on the findings:

| Finding | Recommended Skill | Action |
|:--------|:-----------------|:-------|
| LinkedIn needs improvement | **/linkedin-coach** | Profile audit and optimization |
| Content gaps identified | **/linkedin-coach** | Content strategy and calendar |
| resume doesn't match online presence | **/application-optimizer** | resume optimization with consistency |
| Interview questions generated | **/interview-master** | Full interview prep and mock |
| Company culture concerns found | **/application-optimizer** | Deeper company research |
| Career narrative inconsistent | **/career-navigator** | Networking intelligence and strategy |
| Considering career change | **/career-transitions** | Portfolio career or AI readiness |

## Relationship to /social-media-review

`/social-media-review` is the **lightweight version** of the social media audit within this skill:

| Feature | /social-media-review | /employer-footprint |
|:--------|:--------------------|:-------------------|
| Social media check | Quick scan | Deep audit |
| Google presence search | Basic | Comprehensive |
| resume cross-reference | No | Yes |
| Company culture mapping | No | Yes |
| Scored dashboard (1-10) | No | Yes |
| Interview questions | No | Yes |
| Parallel research agents | No | Yes (8 agents) |
| Best for | Quick check, graduates | Full pre-application audit |

**When to recommend /social-media-review instead:**
- User is a graduate or early career and just wants a quick check
- User asks to "review my social media" or "check my Instagram"
- User wants privacy settings advice and cleanup guidance
- User doesn't have a target company and isn't doing a formal job search yet
